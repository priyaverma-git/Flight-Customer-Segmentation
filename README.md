✈️ Flight Customer Segmentation
📌 Overview

This project applies data preprocessing, EDA, and clustering techniques to segment airline customers into meaningful groups.
By using KMeans clustering and PCA for dimensionality reduction, we uncover customer patterns that can help airlines design personalized marketing strategies, loyalty programs, and service improvements.
